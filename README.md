# Algorithm Visualizer - [Try it out on GitHub Pages!](https://a-georgiou.github.io/Algorithm-Visualiser/)

Welcome to the **Algorithm Visualizer** project! This tool is designed to provide visual representations of various common algorithms in Computer Science, making it easier for students and learners to understand and interact with these fundamental concepts.

Link to hosted site: https://a-georgiou.github.io/Algorithm-Visualiser/

### Initialised with React + Vite
The project is built using [React](https://reactjs.org/) and [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/), ensuring a fast and responsive user experience.

## Features

### Sorting Algorithms
1. **Bubble Sort**: Watch as the simplest sorting algorithm compares and swaps elements to sort the array.
2. **Quick Sort**: See the divide-and-conquer approach in action, partitioning arrays and recursively sorting the partitions.

### Search Algorithms (Coming Soon)
- **Linear Search**
- **Binary Search**

### Pathfinding Algorithms
1. **Dijkstra's Algorithm**: Visualize the shortest path between nodes in a graph, ensuring the most efficient route.
2. **A* Algorithm**: Experience a more advanced pathfinding algorithm that uses heuristics to optimize the search.
3. **Breadth-First Search (BFS)**: Explore the graph level by level.
4. **Depth-First Search (DFS)**: Dive deep into the graph to find a path.

### Maze Generation Algorithms
- **Recursive Division**
- **Randomized Prim's Algorithm**
- **Randomized Kruskal's Algorithm**

### Graph Algorithms (Coming Soon)
- **Minimum Spanning Tree (Prim's and Kruskal's)**
- **Topological Sort**
